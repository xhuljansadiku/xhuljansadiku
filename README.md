👋 Welcome to My GitHub


🚀 Who I Am
I’m Xhuljan Sadiku, a passionate Full Stack Developer dedicated to bringing ideas to life on the web. With a strong foundation in both front-end and back-end technologies, I specialize in creating modern, responsive, and high-performance websites and applications that help businesses grow and succeed online.


💼 What I Do
As a versatile developer, I offer end-to-end web solutions tailored to your unique needs:

- Custom Website Development  
  From single-page landing pages to complex multi-page platforms, I build websites that reflect your brand, engage your audience, and convert visitors into customers.

- E-Commerce & Online Stores 
  I create secure, scalable e-commerce solutions using WooCommerce, Shopify, or custom-built platforms so you can sell products and services seamlessly.

- Responsive Design & UI/UX
  Every project is mobile-first. I craft intuitive interfaces and pixel-perfect layouts that look and feel great on any device—desktop, tablet, or smartphone.

- Back-End & API Development
  Using Node.js, Express, or PHP/Laravel, I develop robust back-end systems and RESTful APIs to power your front end—handling data, authentication, and integrations securely.

- SEO & Performance Optimization  
  I ensure your site loads lightning-fast, follows SEO best practices, and ranks well in search results. Speed, accessibility, and on-page SEO are baked into every build.

- Content Management Systems (CMS) 
  Whether you need WordPress, Strapi, or a custom CMS, I set up easy-to-use content management so you can update your site without a developer.

- Ongoing Support & Maintenance
  Once your project is live, I’m here to keep it running smoothly—updates, backups, security audits, and small feature enhancements are all part of my service.
